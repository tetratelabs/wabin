# wabin rationale

## Why wabin?
wabin is "wa" as it WebAssembly and "bin" as in Binary format.

This is intentionally similarly named to [wabt][1], although there will be a
small amount of overlap. In both cases, the names are puns, how [Elmer Fudd][2]
would say the word "rabbit" and "robin" respectively.
